# 🌦️ AI-Powered Weather Dashboard

This is a feature-rich weather application built as part of the **AI Engineer Intern - Technical Assessment** for **PM Accelerator**.

---

## 📌 Overview

This Streamlit-based weather dashboard lets users search for any location using a natural input (zip code, town, GPS coordinates, landmarks, etc.) and view real-time weather and 5-day forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app also supports full CRUD operations using MongoDB for persistent storage.
